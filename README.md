# AlarmClock

A set of different alarm clocks that use Node.js and Electron.  The command line app uses Node.js to run.  The GUI app made using Electron and Node.js is still a work in progress, but is functional in what it's supposed to do, and was an attempt to create a user friendly desktop applicaiton.
